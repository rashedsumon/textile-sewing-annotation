# Textile Sewing Operation Annotation AI System

## Overview
This project aims to automatically analyze and annotate video footage of sewing operations in the textile manufacturing industry. The system uses Standard GSD (General Sewing Data) codes to label specific sewing tasks.

## Features
- Download dataset automatically using KaggleHub.
- Annotate video footage with accurate timestamps for specific sewing operations.
- Labels are assigned using Standard GSD codes (e.g., SEW, APSH, ARPN).

## Requirements
- Python 3.11.0
- OpenCV for video processing
- Numpy for data manipulation
- Streamlit for deploying the app
- KaggleHub for automatic dataset downloading

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
